# Whitelist-Dapp
Imagine you are launching your NFT collection named Crypto Devs. 
You want to give your early supporters access to a whitelist for your collection, so this is a whitelist dapp for Crypto Devs.
Whitelist access should be given to the first 10 users for free who want to get in.
This is a website where people can go and enter into the whitelist.

#Tech/Framework Used
The frontend for this Website has been simply created using HTML, CSS and JS.

The contract has been written in Solidity, and the contract deployment has taken place using Hardhat on Goerli Testnet.

Finally, the website uses Next.js framework and has been deployed on Vercel.
